The following maps have no default trader locations and spawns setup yet:

- Banov
- DeerIsle
- Livonia (Enoch)
- Esseker
- Itzek
- Rostow
- Valning

If you still want to use the market system on one of these maps you can use the DayZ-Editor Mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2250764298&searchtext=DayZ+Editor)
to create your own locations and place the needed trader NPCs or objects.
The mod allows you to place down objects and NPCs and export it to the needed format for expansion (.map files).
For more on how to setup the market system can be found on the offical DayZ-Expansion Wiki: https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-The-Market-System
